# Jason Nestmann portfolio site
### Code Louisville FEWD 2017 Project

This website is intended to satisfy the Code Louisville 2017 FEWD class personal project.


**Description:** I created this website to serve as a portfolio for potential employers.  While I intend to post projects to GitHub as well, I wanted a place that could collect examples of my work *without* forcing visitors to navigate to multiple repositories.


**Instructions** To view this website you only need to download the project and open the index.html file.  The contact form doesn't currently work, but will be added once I know backend programming.


The [FEWD Project Requirements](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Front-end-Web-Development-Project-Requirements) include:
1. Responsive to three different devices or browser sizes.
    The page should be responsive at 768 and 992.
    At 768 it goes from one to two columns.  The navbar also goes from the toggle button to right floated words.
    At 992 the profile picture moves to after the welcome paragraph.  The portfolio links also move into a box next to the portfolio paragraph instead of floating under the paragraph.  Also increased font size on larger screen.
2. Utilizes at least one framework or library
    The main portfolio page uses Bootstrap.
3. Code has appropriate comments
    I sectioned my css.
4. Project posted on GitHub
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jnestmann/FEWD-Jason-Nestmann)
5. Project must include a README
    The README has both description and instruction paragraphs.
    
    
    
I also included an image gallery page that uses JQuery.  The image gallery is responsive, adjusting the overlay based on screen size.

The other link is to an app using just javascript (no libraries) and is responsive at the 600px breakpoint to ensure that the browser window is wide enough for the application to appear on the screen without scrolling.
