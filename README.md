# Jason Nestmann portfolio site
### Code Louisville FEWD 2017 Project

This website is intended to satisfy the Code Louisville 2017 FEWD class personal project.  This site can also be seen at [jason-nestmann.info](http://www.jason-nestmann.info)

**Description:** I created this website to serve as a portfolio for potential employers.  While I intend to post projects to GitHub as well, I wanted a place that could collect examples of my work without forcing visitors to navigate to multiple repositories.

To view this website you only need to run the index.html file.

The requirements include:
1. Responsive to three different devices or browser sizes.
2. Utilizes at least one framework or library
3. Code has appropriate comments
4. Project posted on GitHub
5. Project must include a README
